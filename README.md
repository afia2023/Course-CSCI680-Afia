File1: updated_method_extractor.py
Purpose: This script is used to extract method code and documentation from GitHub repositories. It has processed six Python projects, generating a separate CSV file for each project that captures the essential details of Python methods and their corresponding documentation.

File2: json_combined.py
Purpose: This utility script combines all six CSV files into a single JSON file, named Dataset_method.json. This merged dataset contains approximately 32,000 entries of Python methods, providing a comprehensive resource for further analysis.

File3: main3.py
Purpose: This script is the core of our n-gram model processing. It handles the training, evaluation, and final output generation of different n-gram models, facilitating a thorough analysis of the n-gram model's performance.

File4: output_results5.txt
Purpose: This text file contains detailed outputs from the n-gram model evaluations, including accuracy metrics and other statistical data that highlight the performance of the models throughout the testing phase. It includes accuracy scores and other relevant metrics that provide insight into each model's performance, emphasizing how well they predict subsequent tokens in Python method code.

File5: best_model_3_gram3.pkl
Purpose: This file stores the best-performing 3-gram model, selected based on its validation accuracy. It is a ready-to-use model for predicting the next token of Python methods
File6: N-gram(assignment-Afia)
Purpose: This document serves as the final report for the assignment, detailing the methodologies, processes, and outcomes of the n-gram modeling assignment, providing insights into the effectiveness and applications of the generated models.
