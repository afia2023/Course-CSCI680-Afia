File1: updated_method_extractor.py
Purpose: This script is used to extract method code and documentation from GitHub repositories. It has processed six Python projects, generating a separate CSV file for each project that captures the essential details of Python methods and their corresponding documentation.

File2: json_combined.py
Purpose: This utility script combines all six CSV files into a single JSON file, named Dataset_method.json. This merged dataset contains approximately 32,000 entries of Python methods, providing a comprehensive resource for further analysis.

File3: main3.py
Purpose: This script is the core of our n-gram model processing. It handles the training, evaluation, and final output generation of different n-gram models, facilitating a thorough analysis of n-gram model performence.

File4: output_results5.txt
Purpose: This text file contains detailed outputs from the n-gram model evaluations, including accuracy metrics and other statistical data that highlight the performance of the models throughout the testing phase.

File5: best_model_3_gram3.pkl
Purpose: This file stores the best-performing 3-gram model, selected based on its validation accuracy. It serves as a ready-to-use model for predicting Python method documentation based on preceding text sequences.

File6: N-gram(assignment-Afia)
Purpose: This document serves as the final report for the assignment, detailing the methodologies, processes, and outcomes of the n-gram modeling assignment, providing insights into the effectiveness and applications of the generated models.
